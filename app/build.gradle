// DexPatcher Patched Application plugin:

apply plugin: 'com.github.lanchon.dexpatcher.patched-application'

// The DexPatcher Patched Application plugin produces a modified Android application by
// applying changes to code, manifest and resources of a source application provided as
// an Android APK or a DexPatcher APK library.

dependencies {
    // The source application is defined as a Gradle dependency.

    // It is defined either as an Android APK dependency:
    sourceApk fileTree(dir: 'apk', include: ['*.apk', '*.jar', '*.zip'])

    // Or as a DexPatcher APK library dependency:
    //sourceApkLibrary fileTree(dir: 'apklib', include: ['*.apklib'])

    // The contents of the 'apk' and 'apklib' project subdirectories are included in
    // these configurations by default. Exactly one source application dependency
    // must be available to the build.

// General Plugin Configuration
dexpatcherConfig {
    // This should point to a local clone of the DexPatcher Gradle plugin support tool
    // repo that is available here: https://github.com/Lanchon/DexPatcher-gradle-tools
    // But instead of defining the directory here, add a 'dexpatcher.dir' entry to the
    // 'local.properties' of the root project. That way it becomes available to all
    // subprojects and the local configuration is not posted to the VCS.
    //dir = '~/android/dexpatcher/dexpatcher-gradle-tools'

    // Plugin-Specific Configuration
    patchedApplication {
        // Displays package and version information of the source app on every build.
        // Note that this info can also be queried by invoking the 'sourceAppInfo' task.

        // Enable import of Java symbols from the source app. Defaults to true.

        // Speed up debug builds by enabling multi-threaded multi-dex processing for them,
        // but only if multi-dex mode is already enabled for them. Defaults to true.
        //multiDexThreadedForMultiDexDebugBuilds = true

        // Speed up debug builds by enabling multi-threaded multi-dex processing for them,
        // even if multi-dex mode is not already enabled for them. Note that apps patched
        // in multi-dex mode are only compatible with devices running Android 5.0 (API 21)
        // and later. Defaults to false.
        //multiDexThreadedForAllDebugBuilds = true
    }

    // Apktool Task Defaults
    apktool {
        // Use a framework provided in a project subdirectory:

        // v1.2.0 and later, so this setting is no longer needed for normal operation.
        //apiLevel = 14

        // DexPatcher multi-dex patching mode is automatically enabled if multi-dex is
        // enabled in the Android build system. However, you can also enable multi-dex
        // patching manually:
        //multiDex = true
        // Note that multi-dex need not be enabled in the Android build system unless the
        // patch dex itself is large and requires it. The dex sizes of the source app and
        // the patched app are not relevant.

        // Enable multi-threaded multi-dex processing, if multi-dex mode is already enabled.
        // Multi-threaded processing is faster but produces more dex files than the bare
        // minimum required by the contents of the patched app. This is recommended for
        // debug builds but not for releases.
        //multiDexThreaded = true

        // Set the number of multi-dex processing threads, if multi-threaded multi-dex mode
        // is already enabled. Defaults to the number of available processors up to 4.
        //multiDexJobs = 8

        // The maximum number of items in the pools of the output dex files. This limits,
        // for example, the number of method references in each dex file. Defaults to 65536.
        //maxDexPoolSize = 65536

        // The package name of the used DexPatcher annotations. Useful to handle rogue apps
        // that want to disallow patching by intentionally clashing with standard DexPatcher
        // annotation names. Defaults to 'lanchon.dexpatcher.annotation'.
        //annotationPackage = 'lanchon.dexpatcher.annotation'

        // Enable implicit ignore of trivial default constructors. Defaults to true.
        //constructorAutoIgnore = true

        // Enable compatibility with the deprecated DexTag.
        //compatDexTag = true

        // The verbosity of the DexPatcher tool. One of QUIET, NORMAL, VERBOSE or DEBUG.
